# Develop a kNN classifier from scratch
The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is commonly available within the standard machine learning libraries, but implementing the algorithm from scratch is a good exercise to better understand important aspects of the approach and experiment your own variations.
In this notebook, you find some code snippets that will guide you through the development process by filling in the missing code, as indicated in the cells below.
